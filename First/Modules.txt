Modules:
Modules allow you to write code in more than one file. This way we dont have to write all the
app in the file.
In Node every file with code is module.
We use the require() function to use the code in modules.
let mysql = require('mysql');
Now the require function looks for the mysql package in the node_modules folder.


let myModule = require('./mymodule');
"./" require function will know where to look like in the same folder. if not it will look into
node_modules folder.
